## Description
This professional portfolio project was a test of my abilities to build a site from scrath using HTML and CSS.
It has the following features:
- Semantic HTML tags for clarity of code
- External CSS sheet with a proper reset to reduce compatibility issues
- Animated links and title cards for my projects
- Complex CSS styling, including flex-boxes
- Dynamic design that changes to match your viewport
